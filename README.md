# Mortar

This is a meta-repo that tracks all the templates that Mozilla is offering for Open Web Apps. Check out the README of each template for usage instructions.

The following templates are available:

* [`mortar-app-stub`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-app-stub): a blank template that comes only with the basic things required to get started
* [`mortar-privileged-app-stub`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-privileged-app-stub): a privileged app template that demonstrates the usage of a privileged permission (systemXHR)
* [`mortar-game-stub`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-game-stub): a minimal web game template that handles input and a render loop
* [`mortar-list-detail`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-list-detail): comes with a layouts library and sets up a list-detail layout for you
* [`mortar-tab-view`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-tab-view): similar to `mortar-list-detail` but the initial layout has tabs at the bottom, which let you switch between screens.

And finally...

* [`mortar-template-template`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-template-template), a template for building other templates. You probably don't need this one, unless you want to contribute with a brand new template and don't want to start from scratch.

You can view more documentation [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Apps/App_templates).

# Usage

To get all the templates at the same time, just clone this repository:

````
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mozilla/mortar.git

Or download [this ZIP](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar/archive/master.zip) that contains the latest version.

Of course, you can also separately clone the templates you're interested in.
