# Open Web App Templates

This is a meta-repo that tracks all the templates that Mozilla is offering for Open Web Apps. Check out the README of each template for usage instructions.

The following templates are available:

* [`mortar-app-stub`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-app-stub): a blank template that comes only with the basic things required to get started
* [`mortar-game-stub`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-game-stub): a minimal web game template that handles input and a render loop
* [`mortar-list-detail`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-list-detail): comes with a layouts library and sets up a list-detail layout for you
* [`mortar-tab-view`](https://github.com/mozilla/mortar-tab-view), which is similar to `mortar-list-detail` but the initial layout has tabs at the button which let you switch between screens.
