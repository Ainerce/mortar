# Open Web App Templates

This is a meta-repo that tracks all the templates that Mozilla is offering for Open Web Apps.

The base template is `mortar-app-stub`. It is basically a blank template that comes only with the basic things required to get started.

We are building out several layouts so that you can quickly get writing more specific apps, such as a list-detail layout.
