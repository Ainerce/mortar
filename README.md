This is a meta-repo that tracks all the templates that Mozilla is offering for Open Web Apps.

The following templates are available:

* `mortar-app-stub`: a blank template that comes only with the basic things required to get started
* `mortar-list-detail`: comes with a layouts library and sets up a list-detail layout for you
